(ns qa-governor.operation
  "OperationActor — one repo QA pass = one supervised actor run, expressed as
  a langgraph-clj StateGraph (ADR-2607031100's remaining open question: real
  StateGraph wiring, not just the pure rubric/governor/ledger core).

  Mirrors the containment + independent-governor + append-only-ledger
  topology every other actor in this codebase uses (minidrama.operation /
  tashikame.operation / tsumugu.operation / sng.synthesis): the proposal-
  producing node is sealed into :collect, its output is ALWAYS routed through
  qa-governor.governor (:govern) before anything commits to the score ledger.

  Node here is `qa-governor.collectors.repo/collect` — today that means the
  5 DETERMINISTIC, LLM-free evidence collectors (no self-reported score to
  distrust), not yet the qualitative LLM-scoring node ADR-2607031100's Open
  Questions still flag as future work. The governor's evidence/score
  consistency check stays valuable even here: it's a regression guard against
  a collector computing a score its own evidence contradicts, not only a
  defense against an untrusted LLM. Swapping in a real LLM-advisor node later
  is exactly the kind of injected swap this topology is built for — it would
  slot in as an additional proposal source feeding the SAME :govern node,
  no other node needs to change.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected (each a swap, not a rewrite):
    - collect-fn   (real qa-governor.collectors.repo/collect | a test double)
    - rubric       (default-rubric | extend-rubric result)          — :rubric opt
    - ledger-get/-put! (in-memory atom | a future durable store)    — :ledger opt
    - now-ms-fn    (System/currentTimeMillis | a fixed clock in tests)

  This is JVM-only (.clj, not .cljc): collect-fn's real implementation shells
  out to `clojure -M:test`/`:lint` (qa-governor.collectors.clojure-project-shell),
  which has no cljs/SCI equivalent — matching collectors.repo's own scope."
